# world_capitals_quiz
This is a quiz on world capitals. So far I have 96 countries listed. Will add more.
The player gets to decide how many questions they want to answer.
Each time it will generate a random country.
The user must input the correct capital city (case insensitive).
User gets two hints per question by typing in "help".
